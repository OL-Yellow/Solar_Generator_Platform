Update our solar system sizing calculator to incorporate the following nuanced considerations for small households and businesses in Nigeria. The code should maintain the current structure but expand the decision-making framework to address these additional factors:

1. SYSTEM TYPE DETERMINATION:
   - Add a function determine_system_type() that evaluates:
     * Default recommendation should be an integrated system
     * Only recommend portable system if user explicitly indicates dual-use needs between home and business
     * If grid availability is less than 8 hours/day, recommend full solar
     * If grid availability is 8-16 hours/day, evaluate cost-effectiveness of hybrid vs backup-only
     * If grid reliability issues include frequent voltage fluctuations, recommend additional protection components

2. BATTERY TECHNOLOGY SELECTION:
   - Add a function recommend_battery_technology() that considers:
     * If ambient temperature regularly exceeds 35°C, favor lithium over lead-acid
     * If upfront budget is severely constrained, offer lead-acid option with lifecycle cost comparison
     * For daily cycling applications (regular outages), favor lithium
     * For occasional backup only, consider lead-acid
     * Include depth-of-discharge assumptions: 80% for lithium, 50% for lead-acid
     * Factor in replacement cycles: 7-10 years for lithium vs 2-3 years for quality lead-acid

3. SOLAR SIZING ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Update get_system_size() to include:
     * Support for micro-systems starting at 0.2 kW for very small energy needs
     * Location-specific derating factors for dust/harmattan (5-15% additional capacity)
     * Temperature derating (0.5% per °C above 25°C for typical panel temperature)
     * Season-specific sun hours (separate dry/wet season calculations)
     * Option for phased implementation with future expansion capability

4. BATTERY SIZING IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Enhance get_battery_size() to account for:
     * Grid outage pattern analysis (frequency and duration)
     * Critical vs. non-critical load separation
     * Battery temperature performance derating
     * Minimum size requirements for very small systems (at least 0.5 kWh capacity)
     * Cycle life projections based on usage patterns

5. INVERTER CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Modify get_inverter_size() to include:
     * Power quality features needed (surge protection, voltage stabilization)
     * Hybrid inverter options for grid-interactive systems
     * Micro-inverter options for very small systems (< 1 kW)
     * Starting power requirements for motors/pumps if present
     * Ability to handle low-quality grid power

6. COMPONENT PROTECTION:
   - Add a function recommend_protection_components() that suggests specific anti-theft measures:
     * Security cages for outdoor equipment
     * Tamper-proof mounting hardware
     * GPS tracking devices for higher-value systems
     * Secure enclosures with locks
     * Motion sensor alarms for equipment areas
     * Wall or fence mounting options to reduce accessibility
     * Additional recommendations for surge protectors and lightning protection where needed

7. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS:
   - Add a function perform_economic_analysis() that calculates:
     * System payback period vs. generator + fuel costs
     * Monthly savings compared to current energy expenses
     * Lifecycle cost comparison between different battery technologies
     * Modular expansion pathway recommendations for budget constraints

8. SYSTEM MODULARITY:
   - Add a function design_modular_system() that suggests:
     * Initial minimum viable system based on critical loads only
     * Expansion pathway as budget allows
     * Compatible component specifications for future additions

9. DETAILED RECOMMENDATION OUTPUT:
   - Create a function generate_customer_recommendations() that:
     * Lists each recommended component with specific models/sizes
     * Provides clear reasoning for each recommendation (e.g., "We recommend a 3kW inverter because your peak load is 2.4kW, providing headroom for additional appliances")
     * Includes visual representation of the system design
     * Summarizes expected performance metrics (backup duration, daily solar production, etc.)
     * Outlines maintenance requirements and schedules

10. INTERACTIVE MODIFICATION FUNCTIONALITY:
    - Implement modify_customer_selection() function that:
      * Allows customers to adjust individual component specifications
      * Dynamically recalculates system performance and costs based on changes
      * Provides real-time feedback on pros and cons of modifications (e.g., "Reducing battery capacity will lower upfront cost by ₦X but will reduce backup time from Y hours to Z hours")
      * Validates changes to ensure technical compatibility
      * Highlights potential issues if modifications create mismatched components
      * Maintains original recommendation for comparison

Ensure that the code includes proper documentation and clear explanations of the decision logic. The calculator should be user-friendly and provide not just size recommendations but also rationale and alternatives where appropriate. Include input validation to handle edge cases like extremely low energy requirements or unusual usage patterns.
